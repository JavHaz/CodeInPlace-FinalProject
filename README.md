# tkMario

tkMario is a simplified mario clone built in Python/TKinter using CIP's graphics library.  It supports Mario running, jumping, killing enemies, and collecting coins as well as reaching the flag to finish the level.  Blocks, enemies, and coins were all written to be very easily configurable so that it's easy to make new levels.

This was created as a final project for Code In Place(Stanford)
